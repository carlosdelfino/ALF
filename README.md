--THE FIRST CODE

In this work, we show an algorithm to analyze the information of the alarms 
emitted by the components of an optical network, in the presence of a fault, 
aiming to find which network component is causing the failure. The algorithm 
proposed, named Correlated Fault location Algorithm, CFLA, uses the alarms’ 
correlation in order to reduce the list of suspected components shown to the 
network operators. The CFLA is sufficiently robust to work with false alarms, 
lost alarms and components that do not emit alarms when fail. The algorithm is 
described and simulated. The results of the simulations are compared to those 
obtained using another algorithm found in the literature. Index Terms—Alarms, 
Alarms Correlation, failures, Fault Location, and Networks WDM.
